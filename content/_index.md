## 👋 Welcome to Second Language Acquisition (Undergraduate)

You’ll learn how additional languages are acquired—and how that knowledge can make you a sharper learner, teacher, and communicator. We’ll connect **linguistic**, **psychological**, and **social** perspectives to real EFL contexts in China.

---

### What we’ll explore
- **Foundations:** What it means to *know* a language; L1–L2 differences; input, interaction, and development.  
- **Linguistics of SLA:** Interlanguage, developmental sequences, and explanations for learner patterns.  
- **Psychology & Social context:** Attention, memory, motivation, identity, and classroom interaction.  
- **From knowledge to use:** Fluency, pragmatics, and designing tasks that actually help.

### How we’ll learn
- Short mini-lectures + guided discussion  
- Hands-on analysis of **real learner data**  
- Micro-teaching, task design, and peer feedback  
- A small **group project** (poster + 5-min talk in Week 12)

---

### Quick facts (from the syllabus)
- **Meetings:** 12 weeks · 3 sessions/week · 45 minutes each  
- **Audience:** English majors (no prior SLA background needed)  
- **Textbook:** Saville-Troike, *Introducing SLA* (3rd ed.) 
- **Assessments snapshot:** Reading checks · Concept cards · Observation logs · Final poster talk/project

---

### Why this matters (what you’ll take away)
- Clear explanations of **key SLA concepts** (input, transfer, motivation, aptitude).  
- Confidence reading basic research and **testing predictions** in class.  
- Practical tools for **feedback, task design, and fluency building**.  
- A sharper eye for patterns in **Chinese ↔ English** learning.

---

### How to succeed
- **Prepare lightly but regularly** (short readings + quick checks).  
- **Engage in activities**—the labs and micro-teaching are where ideas “click.”  
- **Use examples from your world** (tutoring, media, social apps, exams).  
- **Work with your group**—share data, divide tasks, rehearse the poster talk.
