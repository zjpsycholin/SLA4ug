## Course Description
This undergraduate seminar introduces how additional languages are learned, connecting **linguistic**, **psychological**, and **social** perspectives to practical EFL contexts in China. Using Saville-Troike & Barto (3rd ed.) as the anchor text, the course builds from foundational concepts and methods to interlanguage development, cognitive factors, social context, and how learners turn knowledge into fluent use. Parts: **I. Foundations (Chs. 1–2)** → **II. Linguistic development & explanations (Ch. 3)** → **III. Psychology & social context (Chs. 4–5)** → **IV. Knowledge for use & synthesis (Ch. 6; presentations)**. *(Chapter 7 is not covered.)*

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Explain core SLA concepts (e.g., input, interaction, transfer, motivation, aptitude) with clear examples.
- Read and summarize empirical studies at a basic level (design, measures, key findings, limitations).
- Analyze short samples of learner language to identify developmental patterns and likely influences.
- Compare complementary perspectives (linguistic, psychological, sociocultural) and articulate how each informs practice.
- Propose a small, feasible classroom diagnostic or mini-study connecting theory to instruction.
- Communicate claims and evidence clearly in academic English (oral and written).

## Methods of Instruction
Short mini-lectures, guided discussion, student-led concept cards, micro-teaching, and hands-on **data critique** / **task design**. Expect close reading, practical application, and constructive peer feedback.

**Total = 100%**

## 12-Week Schedule (Topics • Chapters • Key Issues)
We read selectively and thematically; not every section of each chapter is assigned. Page-level reading bullets can be posted weekly.  
**Textbook coverage:** Saville-Troike (3rd ed.) **Chs. 1–6 only**; **Ch. 7 omitted**.

### Week 1 — What is SLA?
**Chapter:** Ch. 1  
**Topics:** What SLA studies; why it matters (EFL China); key terms; sources of evidence.  
**Key issues:** Competence vs performance; how theory → predictions → simple classroom tests.

### Week 2 — Foundations I: L1–L2 Connections & Transfer
**Chapter:** Ch. 2 (selected)  
**Topics:** L1 vs L2 acquisition; cross-linguistic influence; sensitive period ideas.  
**Key issues:** Concrete predictions for common Chinese↔English differences (no heavy formalism).

### Week 3 — Foundations II: Input, Intake & Methods
**Chapter:** Ch. 2 (selected)  
**Topics:** Input vs intake; comprehensibility, frequency, noticing; naturalistic/classroom/corpus/experimental methods.  
**Key issues:** How input quality/quantity shapes outcomes; reading studies with basic design literacy.

### Week 4 — Linguistics of SLA I: Interlanguage & Development
**Chapter:** Ch. 3 (selected)  
**Topics:** Interlanguage; developmental sequences; variability; error vs performance analysis.  
**Key issues:** Evidence for development vs fossilization; linking learner samples to stage-like progress.

### Week 5 — Linguistics of SLA II: Explanations & Focus on Form
**Chapter:** Ch. 3 (selected)  
**Topics:** Explanatory approaches (contrastive/error analysis, UG-oriented, functional/usage-based); form–meaning mappings; focus on **form** vs **forms**.  
**Key issues:** When noticing helps; task design and input enhancement.

### Week 6 — Psychology of SLA I: Attention, Memory, Learning
**Chapter:** Ch. 4 (selected)  
**Topics:** Attention, working memory; implicit vs explicit learning; depth of processing.  
**Key issues:** Matching task demands to memory/attention limits; practical ways to increase processing depth.  
*Milestone:* **Final Project proposal due** (end of week).

### Week 7 — Psychology of SLA II: Individual Differences (+ Midterm)
**Chapter:** Ch. 4 (selected)  
**Topics:** Aptitude; motivation; affect (anxiety, WTC); self-regulation and strategies.  
**Key issues:** What teachers can influence; designing support for different learner profiles.  
*Assessment:* **Midterm Test** (Session A).

### Week 8 — Social Contexts I: Interaction & Feedback
**Chapter:** Ch. 5 (selected)  
**Topics:** Classroom interaction (teacher talk, pair work, IRF); feedback types (recasts, prompts) and uptake; sociocultural concepts (mediation, ZPD).  
**Key issues:** Creating opportunities for noticing and pushed output; constructive feedback choices.

### Week 9 — Social Contexts II: Identity, Investment & Settings
**Chapter:** Ch. 5 (selected)  
**Topics:** Identity, agency, communities of practice; naturalistic vs classroom learning; assessment considerations.  
**Key issues:** How social context shapes participation and outcomes in EFL China.

### Week 10 — Knowledge for Use I: Fluency & Automatization
**Chapter:** Ch. 6 (selected)  
**Topics:** From knowledge to performance; fluency components (speed, breakdown, repair); practice and automatization; formulaic sequences.  
**Key issues:** Sustainable fluency routines; simple classroom fluency metrics.  
*Milestone:* **Project Draft (poster outline) due**.

### Week 11 — Knowledge for Use II: Discourse & Pragmatics
**Chapter:** Ch. 6 (selected)  
**Topics:** Communicative competence; discourse organization; pragmatics (politeness, implicature, speech acts).  
**Key issues:** Mapping meaning to form across contexts; designing tasks that promote transfer beyond the classroom.

### Week 12 — Integration, Applications & Presentations
**Chapters:** Synthesis across Chs. 1–6 (no new chapter)  
**Topics:** Bringing together linguistic, psychological, and social perspectives; translating insights into practical, defensible teaching choices.  
**Key issues:** Clear claims + evidence; actionable takeaways.  
*Assessment:* **Final Posters & 5-min Talks**; reflective note.

### Assignments (details)

#### Observation Log (3 × ~400 words each)
Observe (or gather) brief samples of learner English (e.g., tutoring, film subtitles, corpora). Describe context, transcribe a small excerpt, analyze with course concepts, and propose a feedback or task idea.

#### Final Project (Group of 3–4)
Pick one focused question (e.g., “Does recast vs prompt change uptake in pair work?”).  
**Deliverables:** 1-page proposal → small data sample or task design → poster + 5-min talk (Week 12) → share materials.
