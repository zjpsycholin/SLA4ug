## Course Description
This undergraduate seminar introduces how additional languages are learned, connecting **linguistic**, **psychological**, and **social** perspectives to practical EFL contexts in China. Using Saville-Troike & Barto (3rd ed.) as the anchor text, the course builds from foundational concepts and methods to interlanguage development, cognitive factors, social context, and how learners turn knowledge into fluent use.   

Parts: **I. Foundations (Chs. 1–2)** → **II. Linguistic development & explanations (Ch. 3)** → **III. Psychology & social context (Chs. 4–5)** → **IV. Knowledge for use & synthesis (Ch. 6; presentations)**. *(Chapter 7 is not covered.)*

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Explain core SLA concepts (e.g., input, interaction, transfer, motivation, aptitude) with clear examples.
- Read and summarize empirical studies at a basic level (design, measures, key findings, limitations).
- Analyze short samples of learner language to identify developmental patterns and likely influences.
- Compare complementary perspectives (linguistic, psychological, sociocultural) and articulate how each informs practice.
- Propose a small, feasible classroom diagnostic or mini-study connecting theory to instruction.
- Communicate claims and evidence clearly in academic English (oral and written).

## Methods of Instruction
Short mini-lectures, guided discussion, micro-teaching, and hands-on **data critique** / **task design**.     

Expect close reading, practical application, and constructive peer feedback.

## 12-Week Chapter-based Course Schedule (Topics • Chapters • Key Issues)
We read selectively and thematically; not every section of each chapter is assigned.  
**Textbook coverage:** Saville-Troike (3rd ed.) **Chs. 1–6 only**; **Ch. 7 omitted**.


### Chapter 1 — What is SLA?

> **Weeks:** Week 1  
> **Chapter:** Saville-Troike & Barto (3rd ed.), **Ch. 1**

**Focus**   

Define **SLA** and where it happens (formal / informal); why it matters; frame the field with the **three core questions** and core lenses (**linguistic**, **psychological**, **social**).   

**Topics**

- SLA definition; high-level **L1 vs L2**
- **Competence vs performance**; **communicative competence**
- Types/purposes of “second languages” (second / foreign / library / auxiliary / **LSP**)
- Evidence sources: **naturalistic**, **classroom**, **corpus**, **experimental**
- SLA as **multidisciplinary** (complementary perspectives)
  
**Key Issues**

- Turn concepts into **testable predictions** (theory → simple classroom checks)
- Classify **English in your context** (implications for **input** and **motivation**)
- Distinguish data reflecting **competence** vs **performance**
- **Integrate** multiple perspectives rather than treat them as conflicting


### Chapter 2 — Foundations of Second Language Acquisition

> **Weeks:** Weeks 2–3  
> **Chapter:** Saville-Troike & Barto (3rd ed.), **Ch. 2**

**Focus**  
Situate SLA within **multilingualism** as the global norm and define **multi-competence**. Compare **L1 vs L2 learning** across initial, intermediate, and final states. Introduce **transfer** (positive/negative), the roles of **input** and **interaction**, key **facilitating conditions** (feedback, aptitude, motivation, instruction), **age/sensitive-period** considerations, and the **linguistic–psychological–social** perspectives that frame research and pedagogy.

**Topics**  
- Multilingualism & **multi-competence**; motives for L2; why counting speakers is complex  
- L1 acquisition essentials: **innate capacity**, systematic development, role of **input/interaction**, **sensitive/critical period**  
- **Initial → intermediate → final** states in L1 vs L2; interlanguage and **variability**  
- **Cross-linguistic influence**: positive/negative **transfer**; transfer of conceptual and interactional skills  
- **Conditions for acquisition**: input (necessary), interaction (facilitator); **facilitators**—feedback, aptitude, motivation, instruction  
- **Frameworks**: linguistic (internal/external), psychological (processing, aptitude, learning mechanisms), social (micro/macro context)

**Key Issues**  
- Distinguish **transfer-driven** vs **developmental** patterns in learner data  
- Make **testable predictions** for your context (e.g., articles, plural **-s**, tense/aspect, subject expression, modifier order) and design simple classroom checks  
- Balance **necessary** (input) and **facilitating** (interaction, feedback, motivation, instruction) conditions in course tasks  
- Use multiple **perspectives** (linguistic–psychological–social) to interpret evidence and guide teaching choices



### Chapter 3 — The Linguistics of Second Language Acquisition

> **Weeks:** Weeks 4–5  
> **Chapter:** Saville-Troike & Barto (3rd ed.), **Ch. 3**

**Focus**  
Understand learner **interlanguage** as a systematic developing grammar, the typical **developmental sequences** (e.g., morpheme order), and **variability** across tasks/contexts. Compare explanations for L2 morphosyntax and lexicon—**L1 influence**, **universals/markedness**, and usage/frequency—then connect these to **focus on form** in teaching (noticing, input enhancement, feedback).

**Topics**  
- **Interlanguage & development:** stage-like growth; morpheme/order findings; stability vs change  
- **Variability:** task demands, planning time, register/context effects on performance  
- **Sources of difficulty:** L1 transfer vs **universal/markedness** pressures; fossilization risks  
- **Explanatory approaches:** contrastive & error analysis (historical), **UG-oriented** accounts (features/parameters, reassembly), **functional/usage-based** views (input frequency, constructions)  
- **Form–meaning mapping:** tense/aspect, agreement, articles, word order; role of salience and frequency  
- **Pedagogical links:** **focus on form** vs **forms**, noticing, input enhancement, corrective feedback; task design

**Key Issues**  
- Diagnose **developmental** vs **transfer-driven** patterns in learner data  
- Manage **variability**: design tasks that reveal competence (not just performance noise)  
- Prioritize **high-impact forms** (salience, frequency, communicative payoff) for focus-on-form work  
- Anticipate common **Chinese↔English** challenges (articles, plural **-s**, **-ed**, **3sg -s**, modifier order) and plan targeted noticing + feedback


### Chapter 4 — The Psychology of Second Language Acquisition

> **Weeks:** Weeks 6–7  
> **Chapter:** Saville-Troike & Barto (3rd ed.), **Ch. 4**

**Focus**  
Explain how **cognitive mechanisms** and **individual differences** shape L2 learning: attention and **noticing**, **working memory** and processing limits, **implicit vs explicit** learning/knowledge, **aptitude**, **motivation** and **affect**, and **learning strategies/self-regulation**. Connect psychology-based models (information/skill acquisition, input processing) to classroom design.

**Topics**  
- **Attention & working memory:** limits, focus allocation, task demands  
- **Noticing & depth of processing:** what gets encoded; form–meaning connections  
- **Implicit vs explicit learning/knowledge:** routes, measures, classroom roles  
- **Practice & automatization:** spaced/retrieval practice; fluency building  
- **Cognitive models:** information/skill acquisition; input processing principles  
- **Individual differences:** **aptitude** (components), **motivation** (goals, self-system), **affect** (anxiety/WTC), **strategies** & **self-regulation**  
- **Aptitude–treatment interaction:** matching methods to learner profiles

**Key Issues**  
- **Design for attention:** engineer tasks that direct focus to form–meaning (input enhancement, pushed output)  
- **Manage load:** sequence input → guided practice → communicative use within WM limits  
- **Balance routes:** combine **explicit guidance** with **meaningful practice** to foster implicitization  
- **Build fluency:** use spacing, retrieval, and timed tasks for automatization  
- **Differentiate:** adapt feedback, supports, and goals to **aptitude/motivation/affect** profiles  
- **Assess appropriately:** align measures with **implicit** (speeded/online) vs **explicit** (rule/explanation) outcomes


### Chapter 5 — Social Contexts of Second Language Acquisition

> **Weeks:** Weeks 8–9  
> **Chapter:** Saville-Troike & Barto (3rd ed.), **Ch. 5**

**Focus**  
Explain how **social context** shapes L2 development at two levels: **micro** (input, interaction, feedback inside classrooms and conversations) and **macro** (identity, communities, status, access). Connect interactional practices (negotiation of meaning, **pushed output**, uptake) with **sociocultural mediation** (scaffolding, **ZPD**) to design equitable, high-opportunity learning environments.

**Topics**  
- **Input & interaction:** negotiation of meaning; **teacher talk**, pair/group work, IRF patterns; task types that elicit clarification requests, confirmation checks, and reformulations  
- **Feedback & uptake:** recasts, prompts, explicit correction; conditions that favor noticing, repair, and durable change  
- **Sociocultural Theory:** mediation, scaffolding, **Zone of Proximal Development**; guided participation and tools  
- **Identity & communities:** agency, investment, communities of practice; social networks and participation  
- **Settings & participation:** naturalistic vs classroom; institutional constraints; classroom discourse norms; code-switching and accommodation; register and pragmatics links

**Key Issues**  
- **Engineer opportunities:** design tasks that ensure **comprehensible input**, require **modified interaction**, and push **meaningful output** with timely feedback  
- **Choose feedback strategically:** balance implicitness (recasts) vs salience (prompts/explicit) to maximize **uptake** and minimize disruption  
- **Promote equitable talk:** vary patterns beyond IRF; structure pairwork/roles to increase **access** and **willingness to communicate**  
- **Honor macro context:** identity, status, and goals shape participation—plan supports that widen access (materials, grouping, norms) and align assessment with interactional growth


### Chapter 6 — Acquiring Knowledge for L2 Use

> **Weeks:** Weeks 10–11  
> **Chapter:** Saville-Troike & Barto (3rd ed.), **Ch. 6**

**Focus**  
Bridge **knowledge → performance**: build **fluency** (speed, stability), promote **automatization** through meaningful practice, leverage **formulaic sequences**, and develop **discourse**, **pragmatic**, and **strategic** competence so learners can use L2 effectively across contexts.

**Topics**  
- **Knowledge vs performance**; components of **fluency** (speed, breakdown, repair)  
- **Automatization**: task repetition, spacing, retrieval, time pressure; input → guided practice → communicative use  
- **Formulaic sequences** (chunks, collocations) and their role in processing efficiency & fluency  
- **Discourse competence**: cohesion, coherence, genre/register, organization of talk/text  
- **Pragmatic competence**: speech acts, politeness/mitigation, implicature; socio- vs pragmalinguistic knowledge  
- **Strategic competence**: planning, monitoring, compensation strategies; pushed output & feedback  
- **Classroom metrics**: simple **CAF** checks (complexity–accuracy–fluency), timed tasks, self-recorded baselines

**Key Issues**  
- Design practice for **automatization** without losing meaning (task cycles, 4/3/2, shadowing, timed reading/speaking)  
- Balance **chunks** with generative grammar: teach formulaic language **in context** for transfer  
- Build **pragmatic awareness**: noticing + role-play + feedback to avoid L1-based misfires  
- Measure what matters: choose valid, light-weight **fluency measures** and track gains over time  
- Promote **transfer** beyond class: vary audiences/registers (emails, presentations, discussions)  
- Give feedback that **supports fluency** (prioritize meaning flow; avoid over-correction during performance)
