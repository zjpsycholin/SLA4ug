## üß© Core Content (aligned to Chapter 2)

### 1) The Prevalence and Nature of Multilingualism
- **Multilingualism is normal** worldwide; learners use languages for different **purposes** (education, work, migration).  
- **Multi-competence:** bilingual knowledge is an **integrated** system, not two separate monolinguals.  
- Why counting speakers is hard (census categories, identity, ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù vs ‚Äúdialect‚Äù).

### 2) The Nature of Language Learning (First Language Acquisition)
- **Innate capacity** & the **logical problem** (limited negative evidence, yet rich competence).  
- **Systematic development** with varying **rates**; role of **input** and **social interaction**; **sensitive/critical period** highlights.

### 3) First vs Second Language Learning: A Three-Phase Comparison
- **Initial state:**  
  - L1 ‚Üí universal initial capacity;  
  - L2 ‚Üí prior **L1 knowledge**, world knowledge, interactional skills; (debate on UG access).  
- **Intermediate states/processes:**  
  - **Interlanguage** shows **systematicity** and **variability**;  
  - **Transfer** (positive/negative) + influence of input/interaction;  
  - **Facilitators:** feedback, aptitude, motivation, instruction matter more for L2.  
- **Final state:**  
  - L1 ‚Üí near-universal native competence;  
  - L2 ‚Üí **variable outcomes**, possibility of **fossilization**, but near-native is possible.

### 4) Theoretical Frameworks for Second Language Acquisition
- **Linguistic perspective**  
  - Internal: UG/principles & parameters, features/markedness, form‚Äìmeaning mappings.  
  - External/functional: discourse/pragmatics pressures, information structure.  
- **Psychological perspective**  
  - Brain & age; **information processing**, **processability**; **connectionism**; **dynamic systems**;  
  - Individual differences: **aptitude**, **motivation**, **affect**, strategies.  
- **Social perspective**  
  - **Interactionist** micro-context (negotiation, feedback, uptake); **SCT** (mediation, ZPD);  
  - Macro-context: **acculturation**, identity/status, communities of practice.

## üìò Study Guide

### I. Review Questions (Short Answer)
1) Define **multilingualism** and **multi-competence**.  
2) What is the **logical problem** in L1 acquisition and why does it matter for SLA?  
3) Contrast the **initial state** in L1 vs L2 learning.  
4) Define **interlanguage** and explain why it shows both **systematicity** and **variability**.  
5) Give one example each of **positive transfer** and **negative transfer** (Mandarin‚ÜíEnglish).  
6) Distinguish **necessary** conditions (input/interaction) from **facilitating** conditions (feedback, aptitude, motivation, instruction).  
7) What is **fossilization** and how is it different from ‚Äútemporary‚Äù errors?  
8) Name the **three SLA frameworks** and one key contribution of each.  
9) State a **testable prediction** for Chinese‚ÜîEnglish based on one framework.  
10) Why do L2 outcomes vary more than L1 outcomes?

#### (Answer key ‚Äî hidden)
<!--
1) Multilingualism = using 2+ languages; multi-competence = integrated knowledge of more than one language in one mind.  
2) Learners acquire rich grammar despite limited negative evidence; motivates innate constraints and careful evidence claims.  
3) L1 starts from universal initial capacity; L2 starts from prior L1 knowledge + world/interactional knowledge (UG access debated).  
4) Interlanguage is a developing L2 system with its own rules; systematic across stages yet variable by task/context.  
5) Positive: shared SVO order helps; Negative: article omission or plural -s omission by transfer from Mandarin.  
6) Necessary: input (and typically interaction); Facilitating: feedback, aptitude, motivation, instruction (boost learning speed/quality).  
7) Fossilization = long-term stabilization of non-target forms; differs from temporary slips or early developmental patterns.  
8) Linguistic: representations/constraints; Psychological: processing/learning mechanisms and individual differences; Social: interaction/identity/context.  
9) Example: If L1 lacks articles, early L2 English will underuse *a/the*; a short writing/speaking probe can test this.  
10) Differences in age, prior L1, input/interaction, motivation/aptitude, and social context produce wider variance.

### ‚≠ê Overview

- **Sensitive/Critical period** ideas and why age patterns differ for L1 vs L2.  
- **Key issue this week:** make concrete, testable predictions for common **Chinese ‚Üî English** differences (articles, subject expression, tense/agreement, word order) using transfer logic (no heavy formalism).

2. Define and illustrate **positive** vs **negative transfer** with Chinese‚ÄìEnglish examples.  
3. Explain why **input** is necessary for both L1 and L2, and how **interaction** functions differently.  
4. Summarize the **Sensitive/Critical Period** idea and relate it to observed L1/L2 outcomes.  
5. Recognize **multi-competence** as distinct from monolingual competence and why this matters for goals/assessment.

### üß© Core content

#### 1) L1 vs L2: the three phases
- **Initial state**  
  - **L1:** biologically endowed capacity for language.  
  - **L2:** prior **L1 knowledge** (major source of transfer), plus world knowledge and interactional skills.
- **Intermediate states & processes**  
  - **Systematic development** (child grammar / **interlanguage**); L2 learners pass through predictable stages.  
  - **Transfer** can help or hinder; maturation no longer drives L2 development.
- **Final state**  
  - **L1:** near-uniform native competence in core grammar/phonology by early childhood.  
  - **L2:** **variable proficiency**; **fossilization** may occur; some reach near-native levels.

#### 2) Transfer: what it predicts
- **Positive transfer**: similarity aids learning (e.g., shared word order or cognates).  
- **Negative transfer**: L1 rule misapplied to L2 ‚Üí error (e.g., preposition misuse, inflection omission).
- **Chinese ‚Üî English predictions (hypothesis examples):**  
  - **Articles**: Mandarin lacks a/the ‚Üí early **omission**/overuse in English.  
  - **Subject expression**: pro-drop L1 ‚Üí more **subject omission** in early English.  
  - **Verbal morphology**: limited inflection in Mandarin ‚Üí **-s/-ed** difficulties.  
  - **Modifier order**: differences in noun-modifying structures ‚Üí **adjective/noun** order slips.  
  These are **testable classroom predictions** derived from transfer logic rather than fixed rules.

#### 3) Input & interaction across L1/L2
- **Input** is necessary for both L1 and L2.  
- **Interaction** is **required** for L1 development; in L2 it is **facilitating** (not strictly required)‚Äîself-study/media can still provide intake.

#### 4) Sensitive/Critical Period (what to take away)
- A **sensitive window** linked to age helps explain L1 completeness; L2 outcomes are more variable and influenced by transfer, aptitude, motivation, and instruction.

#### 5) Perspectives you‚Äôll meet later
- **Linguistic** (e.g., Principles & Parameters, Minimalist), **Psychological** (e.g., Processability, Connectionism), **Social** (e.g., Variation, Sociocultural).  
- **Poverty of the stimulus** and **UG** motivate the idea of innate constraints.

### ‚úÖ Tasks

#### Before class (preview)
- Read the selected Chapter 2 pages; skim the C2 Briefing and C2 Study Guide.  
- Bring **one Chinese‚ÜîEnglish transfer prediction** you expect to see in freshman writing/speaking.

#### During class (activities)
- **Transfer detective:** In pairs, label example sentences as **positive** vs **negative** transfer and explain why.  
- **Mini-timeline:** Place sample learner utterances on an **interlanguage** timeline (early ‚Üí later) and justify.

  - **Measure:** % accurate supply; error types (‚Äúzero‚Äù, ‚Äúoveruse‚Äù).  
  - **Falsifier:** Native-like article use at baseline or errors unrelated to articles.

#### After class (review)
1) **Short reflection (‚âà150‚Äì200 words):** Which prediction matched your experience? What data would convince you it‚Äôs wrong?  
2) **Self-check (answer privately):**  
   a) Define **positive** vs **negative transfer**.  
   b) Summarize **initial/intermediate/final** states for L2.  
   c) State how **input** and **interaction** differ between L1 and L2.
