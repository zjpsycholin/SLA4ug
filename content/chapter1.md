## ‚≠ê Overview
- What **SLA** is, where it happens (**formal** vs **informal**), and **why it matters**.  
- The **three core questions**: *What do learners come to know? How do they acquire it? Why do learners differ?*  
- Framing concepts: **L1 vs L2**, **competence vs performance**, **communicative competence**; SLA as **multidisciplinary**.

---

## üéØ Learning Outcomes
By the end of Chapter 1 you should be able to:
1. Define **SLA** and distinguish **formal** vs **informal** learning contexts.  
2. Explain **L1**, **L2**, **linguistic competence**, **linguistic performance**, and **communicative competence**.  
3. Classify ‚Äúsecond language‚Äù **types/purposes** (second, foreign, library, auxiliary, **LSP**).  
4. Describe SLA‚Äôs **multidisciplinary** nature and recognize common **research evidence** sources.  
5. State the **three core questions** and turn one into a **testable classroom prediction**.

---

## üìñ Readings / Tasks *before class*
- **Read:** Chapter 1 (focus on definitions, competence/performance, types of second language, and overview of perspectives).  
- **Bring:** 1 question + 1 real example (from media/classroom/life) that illustrates an SLA concept.  
- **Mini-task (3‚Äì5 min):** In 2‚Äì3 sentences, classify **English** in your context (second/foreign/library/auxiliary/**LSP**) and explain why.

---

## üß† Key Terms
*SLA; L1; L2; formal learning; informal learning; linguistic competence; linguistic performance; communicative competence; second vs foreign vs library vs auxiliary language; LSP; multilingualism; simultaneous multilingualism; sequential multilingualism; input; interaction; motivation; aptitude; identity; hypothesis; prediction; falsifiability.*

## üß© Core Content
### 1) What is SLA?
- Definition; **where** acquisition happens (formal classrooms ‚Üî informal, daily life).  
- The **three core questions** that guide the field.

### 2) Core Concepts & Definitions
- **L1 / native language / mother tongue** vs **L2** (any language learned after L1).  
- **Linguistic competence** (underlying knowledge) vs **performance** (actual production).  
- **Communicative competence**: using language appropriately across **contexts**.

### 3) Types & Purposes of ‚ÄúSecond Language‚Äù
- **Second language** (locally dominant), **Foreign language** (limited local use), **Library language** (reading-focused), **Auxiliary language** (official/intercommunity functions), **LSP** (e.g., English for Aviation).  
- Why types matter: different **goals**, **input**, and **motivations** shape learning paths.

### 4) SLA as a Multidisciplinary Field
- **Linguistic** lens (internal knowledge; form‚Äìmeaning systems).  
- **Psychological** lens (processing, attention/memory, learning mechanisms, individual differences).  
- **Social** lens (interaction, identity, communities, settings).  
- Integrating lenses prevents ‚Äúblind men & elephant‚Äù misunderstandings.

### 5) Evidence & Methods (where claims come from)
- **Naturalistic** data, **classroom** observation, **corpus** data, **experimental** tasks.  
- Competence vs performance when interpreting learner samples.

### 6) Diversity in Learning & Learners
- **Context** (formal vs informal) and **access to input/interaction**.  
- **Learner differences** (age, aptitude, motivation, identity, strategies).  
- Why outcomes **vary** more in L2 than in L1.

---

## ‚úÖ Tasks

### Before Class (preview)
- Read Chapter 1; complete the mini-task (classify English in your context).  
- Skim the **Key Terms**.

### After Class (review)
- **Short reflection (150‚Äì200 words):** One idea from Ch. 1 in your own words + a prediction it suggests + a tiny way to check it.  
- **Self-check:** Identify whether a sample error reflects **competence** or **performance** (explain your choice).

1) SLA = learning an additional language after the first; studies how languages are added.  
2) L1 = first/native language(s) acquired early; L2 = any language learned after L1.  
3) Naturalistic acquisition via exposure/use (e.g., a child picking up English after moving).  
4) Structured, classroom-based instruction with explicit goals (e.g., an undergraduate course in Arabic).  
5) Competence = underlying knowledge; Performance = actual use/production (may show hesitations/errors).  
6) Psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, social psychology (also linguistics, education).  
7) Simultaneous = multiple languages from very early childhood; Sequential = L2 learned after L1 established.  
8) The specific additional language being learned.  
9) Because it integrates multiple perspectives and methods to explain varied outcomes.  
10) What is learned? How is it learned? Why do learners differ?

### üß© Core content

#### 1) What is SLA?
- **Definition:** Acquisition of additional languages after the first (L1), in both **formal** (classroom) and **informal** (naturalistic) environments.  
- **Three core questions:**  
  1) *What does the learner come to know?*  
  2) *How is this knowledge acquired?*  
  3) *Why are some learners more successful than others?*

#### 2) Core concepts & definitions
- **L1 / native language / mother tongue:** typically acquired early, without conscious effort.  
- **L2:** any language learned after L1; often involves more conscious effort.  
- **Formal** vs **informal** L2 learning: structured classroom instruction vs naturalistic exposure and use.  
- **Linguistic competence** (underlying knowledge) vs **performance** (actual production).  
- **Communicative competence:** effective use across social contexts.

#### 3) Types of ‚Äúsecond languages‚Äù
- **Second language** (locally dominant), **Foreign language** (limited local use), **Library language** (reading-focused),  
  **Auxiliary language** (official/intercommunity functions), **LSP** (occupationally targeted, e.g., ‚ÄúEnglish for Aviation‚Äù).  
- **Why it matters:** goals, input, and motivation differ across types, shaping learning paths.

#### 4) Key characteristics of acquisition
- **Multilingualism:** adding languages.  
- **Simultaneous multilingualism:** multiple L1s from early childhood.  
- **Sequential multilingualism:** L2 after L1 is established‚Äî**central focus of SLA**.

#### 5) SLA is multidisciplinary
- **Psycholinguistics / sociolinguistics:** representation, processing, and social use.  
- **Social psychology:** identity, social motivation, interactional & macro contexts.  
- **Applied linguistics:** synthesis across disciplines‚Äîthe ‚Äúblind men and the elephant‚Äù reminder to integrate perspectives.

#### 6) Diversity in learning & learners
- **Context** (formal vs informal) shapes opportunities and strategies.  
- **Learner characteristics:** gender/age, social class, ethnic identity, intelligence, **aptitude**, **motivation**, personality, strategies.  
- **Social/economic factors** affect opportunities and goals; explains part of why learners differ.

### ‚úÖ Tasks

#### Before class (preview)
- Read Chapter 1 and skim the Study Guide below.  
- In 2‚Äì3 sentences, **classify English** in your context (second/foreign/library/auxiliary/LSP) with a reason.  
- Note one **learner difference** you think matters most in China‚Äôs EFL settings‚Äîand why.

#### During class (activities)
- **Concept sort:** Match each definition to its term (competence, performance, communicative competence‚Ä¶).  
- **Context mapping:** In groups, map examples of **formal** vs **informal** learning from your experience.  
- **Quick debate:** ‚ÄúAptitude vs motivation‚Äîif you could improve only one for your class, which and why?‚Äù

### Practice (micro-lab)
Pick a small **prediction** about context or learner characteristics, then plan a simple check.  
- **Example prediction:** Students with more **informal L2 exposure** report greater willingness to speak in class.  
- **Micro-check:** 5-item anonymous poll + short speaking task; compare self-reports and participation counts.  
- **What would falsify it?** No association or the reverse pattern.
