> **Anchor text:** Saville-Troike, M., & Barto, K. (2015). *Introducing Second Language Acquisition* (3rd ed.), **Chapter 2 (selected)**.  
> **Sources for this week‚Äôs notes:** C2 Briefing + C2 Study Guide.

### ‚≠ê Overview
- How **L1 acquisition** and **L2 acquisition** are alike/different in initial state, developmental processes, and outcomes.  
- **Cross-linguistic influence (transfer)**: when L1 helps (**positive transfer**) or hinders (**negative transfer**) L2 learning.  
- **Sensitive/Critical period** ideas and why age patterns differ for L1 vs L2.  
- **Key issue this week:** make concrete, testable predictions for common **Chinese ‚Üî English** differences (articles, subject expression, tense/agreement, word order) using transfer logic (no heavy formalism).

### üéØ Learning goals
By the end of Week 2 you should be able to:
1. Describe the **initial, intermediate, and final states** for L1 vs L2.  
2. Define and illustrate **positive** vs **negative transfer** with Chinese‚ÄìEnglish examples.  
3. Explain why **input** is necessary for both L1 and L2, and how **interaction** functions differently.  
4. Summarize the **Sensitive/Critical Period** idea and relate it to observed L1/L2 outcomes.  
5. Recognize **multi-competence** as distinct from monolingual competence and why this matters for goals/assessment.

### üìñ Reading (do before class)
- **Required:** Chapter 2 (selected sections noted in class).  
- **Skim:** C2 Briefing (initial/intermediate/final states; sensitive period; transfer) and C2 Study Guide (transfer, input/interaction, glossary).

**Guiding questions**
- Which L1 properties are most likely to **transfer** to English for Chinese learners? Why?  
- Where would you expect **negative transfer** to show up first‚Äîpronunciation, morphology, or word order? Give a guess and a reason.

### üß© Core content

#### 1) L1 vs L2: the three phases
- **Initial state**  
  - **L1:** biologically endowed capacity for language.  
  - **L2:** prior **L1 knowledge** (major source of transfer), plus world knowledge and interactional skills.
- **Intermediate states & processes**  
  - **Systematic development** (child grammar / **interlanguage**); L2 learners pass through predictable stages.  
  - **Transfer** can help or hinder; maturation no longer drives L2 development.
- **Final state**  
  - **L1:** near-uniform native competence in core grammar/phonology by early childhood.  
  - **L2:** **variable proficiency**; **fossilization** may occur; some reach near-native levels.

#### 2) Transfer: what it predicts
- **Positive transfer**: similarity aids learning (e.g., shared word order or cognates).  
- **Negative transfer**: L1 rule misapplied to L2 ‚Üí error (e.g., preposition misuse, inflection omission).
- **Chinese ‚Üî English predictions (hypothesis examples):**  
  - **Articles**: Mandarin lacks a/the ‚Üí early **omission**/overuse in English.  
  - **Subject expression**: pro-drop L1 ‚Üí more **subject omission** in early English.  
  - **Verbal morphology**: limited inflection in Mandarin ‚Üí **-s/-ed** difficulties.  
  - **Modifier order**: differences in noun-modifying structures ‚Üí **adjective/noun** order slips.  
  These are **testable classroom predictions** derived from transfer logic rather than fixed rules.

#### 3) Input & interaction across L1/L2
- **Input** is necessary for both L1 and L2.  
- **Interaction** is **required** for L1 development; in L2 it is **facilitating** (not strictly required)‚Äîself-study/media can still provide intake.

#### 4) Sensitive/Critical Period (what to take away)
- A **sensitive window** linked to age helps explain L1 completeness; L2 outcomes are more variable and influenced by transfer, aptitude, motivation, and instruction.

#### 5) Perspectives you‚Äôll meet later
- **Linguistic** (e.g., Principles & Parameters, Minimalist), **Psychological** (e.g., Processability, Connectionism), **Social** (e.g., Variation, Sociocultural).  
- **Poverty of the stimulus** and **UG** motivate the idea of innate constraints.

### ‚úÖ Tasks

#### Before class (preview)
- Read the selected Chapter 2 pages; skim the C2 Briefing and C2 Study Guide.  
- Bring **one Chinese‚ÜîEnglish transfer prediction** you expect to see in freshman writing/speaking.

#### During class (activities)
- **Transfer detective:** In pairs, label example sentences as **positive** vs **negative** transfer and explain why.  
- **Mini-timeline:** Place sample learner utterances on an **interlanguage** timeline (early ‚Üí later) and justify.  
- **Age & outcomes quick poll:** Which aspects (phonology vs morphosyntax vs pragmatics) feel most age-sensitive?

### Practice (micro-lab)
Design a **5-minute diagnostic** for one prediction:  
- **Example:** ‚ÄúIf L1 lacks article morphology, beginners will omit **a/the** in English writing.‚Äù  
  - **Task:** 8-sentence cloze (articles + noun modifiers).  
  - **Measure:** % accurate supply; error types (‚Äúzero‚Äù, ‚Äúoveruse‚Äù).  
  - **Falsifier:** Native-like article use at baseline or errors unrelated to articles.

#### After class (review)
1) **Short reflection (‚âà150‚Äì200 words):** Which prediction matched your experience? What data would convince you it‚Äôs wrong?  
2) **Self-check (answer privately):**  
   a) Define **positive** vs **negative transfer**.  
   b) Summarize **initial/intermediate/final** states for L2.  
   c) State how **input** and **interaction** differ between L1 and L2.  
   d) What does the **Sensitive/Critical Period** claim, in one sentence?

## üìò Study Guide (Week 2 focus)
Use these to quiz yourself:

**Short-answer prompts**
- Define **multi-competence** and explain why L2 users aren‚Äôt ‚Äútwo monolinguals in one.‚Äù  
- Give one **positive transfer** and one **negative transfer** example you expect for Chinese learners of English.  
- Explain the **poverty of the stimulus** idea in one or two lines.  
- Name **two** frameworks under the **linguistic perspective** you‚Äôll encounter this term.

**Glossary to know this week:** *interlanguage; fossilization; multi-competence; positive/negative evidence; positive/negative transfer; poverty of the stimulus; Universal Grammar; Sensitive/Critical Period; learner language.*
